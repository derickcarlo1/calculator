# Calculator Program
This program is a simple calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is written in Python and runs in the command line.

# Installation
To use this program, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the source code for the calculator program from this repository.

# Usage
Running the Program in the Command Line
To run the calculator program in the command line, open a terminal window or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then type the following command:
'python calculator.py'
This will start the program and display a prompt asking you to enter the first number.
1. Enter the first number and press Enter. Then enter the second number and press Enter again. The program will then ask you to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
2. Enter the desired operation and press Enter. The program will perform the calculation and display the result.
3. If you enter an invalid input, such as a letter instead of a number, the program will display an error message and prompt you to enter valid numbers.
4. After each calculation, the program will ask if you want to try again or not. If you choose not to try again, the program will exit.

# Running the Program in VS Code
To run the calculator program in VS Code, open the program's source code file (calculator.py) in VS Code. Then open the terminal window in VS Code by clicking on the "Terminal" menu and selecting "New Terminal".

In the terminal window, navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then type the following command:
python calculator.py
This will start the program and display a prompt asking you to enter the first number.

1. Enter the first number and press Enter. Then enter the second number and press Enter again. The program will then ask you to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
2. Enter the desired operation and press Enter. The program will perform the calculation and display the result.
3. If you enter an invalid input, such as a letter instead of a number, the program will display an error message and prompt you to enter valid numbers.

After each calculation, the program will ask if you want to try again or not. If you choose not to try again, the program will exit.

# Note
Note that:

If VS Code is not recognizing the termcolor module, it could be because the module is not installed in the Python environment that you are using with VS Code.

To check if termcolor is installed, you can open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

sql

pip show termcolor

If termcolor is not installed, you can install it by running the following command:

pip install termcolor

Once the module is installed, you should be able to import it in your Python code as usual. If you are still having issues with VS Code recognizing the termcolor module after installing it, you may need to check your VS Code configuration and ensure that it is using the correct Python environment.
